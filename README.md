# base16-helios-exported-themes

[Helios](https://github.com/reyemxela/base16-helios-scheme) is a [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) colorscheme. This repo mainly serves to hold the themes exported from the official templates,
so that if anyone wants Helios for a specific application, they don't have to go through the entire base16 builder/scheme/generation process if they don't want to.
